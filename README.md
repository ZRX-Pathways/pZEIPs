# ZRXPATH Experiment 1: Accelerating Funding for 0x Improvement Proposals
## Purpose
ZRXPATH is a community-based initiative that aims to make the protocol more performant, innovative, and sustainable via the implementation of enabling structures and actionable pathways, providing a better experience for core protocol contributors. 

0x Improvement Proposals (ZEIPs) describe standards and protocol specifications for the 0x protocol.

Core protocol contributors working on ZEIPs may need funding to resource their efforts. This experiment is designed to improve the contributor experience by accelerating the grant process for ZRXPATH-sponsored contributors working on preliminary ZEIPs (pZEIPs). 

## Experiment Design
This experiment is designed to produce learnings and improvements related to the following desired outcome. It incorporates a user story + hypothesis framing: 

### Desired Outcome
How might we make it easier for developers to contribute to the core protocol contracts?

### User Story 
> As a [role], I want [goal/desire], so that [benefit]. 

As a developer, I want to minimize the time and effort associated with grant processes, so that I can focus on the functional job to be done.

### Hypothesis
> We believe [this capability] will result in [this outcome]. We will know we have succeeded when [measurable signal].

We believe that a bespoke grant application and process will result in faster funding. We will know we have succeeded when we see an increase in contributor applications, which is a signal that more contributors are comfortable with the process.  

## Experiment Components
This experiment has two components:

1. Grant application template
2. Decision process

## Considerations
While the accelerated process streamlines funding, it imposes more rigor on the technical specifications and enforces a per-request (incremental) funding structure to balance the risk. 

# Grant Application Template
## Purpose
This template is specific to ZRXPATH. It incorporates elements of the established ZEIP template. It is designed for protocol contributors who are seeking funding from the treasury and has three goals:

1. Frontload technical rigor associated with ZEIPs to inform and accelerate the development process

2. Reduce the administrative burden of managing information tangential to the development process

3. Mitigate risks associated with accelerated decision-making for community-based funding

## Required Information
The template represents the information that will be required to submit a ZEIP for an onchain vote. As the process of development is iterative by nature, some information may not be fully fleshed out early in the process. Nevertheless, the information provided should demonstrate a thoughtful design and development process, with progressively more mature data and descriptions if incremental funding is sought.

# Decision Process
## Purpose
This process is specific to ZRXPATH. It is designed for core contributors working with ZRXPATH who are seeking funding from the treasury and has one goal:

1. Reduce the time between application submittal and funds disbursal

## Process Definition
The process will include the same steps as the existing 0x Grant process, except that the governance forum post and snapshot vote will run concurrently for one week (7 days). If the snapshot vote passes, ZRXPATH will submit the proposal for an onchain vote. This reduces the timeline from 5-6 weeks to 2-3 weeks, depending on the onchain proposal delay (queue).
