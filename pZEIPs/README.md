## Naming convention

A new proposal file should follow the following naming convention:

`<number>_<TITLE>.md`

where:
- `<number>` is the next available number for a pZEIP.
- `<title>` is a short underscore uppercase separated description of the proposal.

in case several documents are required, create a folder respecting the same naming convention and place the documents inside it.
diagrams or images can be gathered in a `assets` subfolder.
